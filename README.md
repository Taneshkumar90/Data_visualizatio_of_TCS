# Data_visualization_of_TCS

## Goal of the project
- Data	Visualisation to	Empowering	Business with	Effective	Insights by answering below given questions.
  - 1: The CEO has requested a trend of the revenue to see if there is any
 seasonality in the store sales.
  - 2: Top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are
 performing.
  - 3: The map chart to show the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with
 the regions that have not.

 - The **OBJECTIVE** of this project is to help an organization to improve revenue and growth in some contries, seasons or in specific areasetc.




## Analysis Approach
### 1. Data Quality Assessment and Data Cleaning
The first step towards generating useful insights from the data was the data prepartion, quality assessment and data cleaning step. 
- 1: First off, I  assure you that I’ve provided the most up to date and error free analysis. After I loaded the data into my software, I scrubbed any records that have **negative quantities and unit price**, as these records needed to be removed in order to provide helpful analysis.
- 2: One of oulier(UK) was deleted in the country column, as the country already has high demand and I’ve been told you’re more focused on the countries where demand can be increased.
  

 ### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis on **revenue** in organization
After the data cleaning process, exploratory analysis on the dataset is performed and the following insights are obtained :


- <b>By **Monthly revenue** </b> :
    As for the first question, the CEO has requested a trend of the revenue to see if there is any
 seasonality in the store sales.This analysis shows that there are some months of the year where
 exceptional growth is witnessed.
- 2: The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase
 in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the
 previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million
 USD, the highest during the entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December,
 therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail
 store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the
 year

</p>

- <b> **Top 10 countries** </b> :
  The second question was, shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are
 performing?
 - This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and I’ve
 been told you’re more focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis
 shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes
 of units bought and revenue generated. I would suggest that these countries should be focused
 on to ensure that measures are taken to capture these markets even more.

</p>

- <b> **Top 10 customer** by purchasing </b> :
  
 According to third questionnthe analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most
 from the store.
 -  The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases
 made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 17%
 more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers
 to generate the revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the
 business is in a good position.

- <b> **Geographical Map** by revenue </b> :
  
 Finally, the map chart shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with
 the regions that have not.
 -  It can be seen that countries such as Netherlands,
 Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should
 invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of
 the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia
 do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these
 areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.

Thanks so much for your time. If you have any questions about the analysis or would like to see
 anything additional after you’ve had time to digest this information, I’d be happy to develop that
 for you.
